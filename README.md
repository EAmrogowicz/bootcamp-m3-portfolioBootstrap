# Unit 3 Challenge: Portfolio Bootstrap

## Description

Build a portfolio page, which you can addjust as the course progresses using
Bootstrap.

A portfolio of work can showcase your skills and talents to employers looking to
fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights your
strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Students who have
portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are
typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp.

## Installation

Follow these instructions to create your project and deploy it to GitHub Pages:

1. Create a new repository on your GitHub account and clone it to your computer.

1. When you're ready to deploy, use the `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`
   commands to save and push your code to your GitHub repository.

1. Navigate to your GitHub repository in the browser and then select the
   Settings tab on the right side of the page.

1. On the Settings page, scroll down to the GitHub Pages section. Then, in the
   section labeled Source, select the `main` branch as your source.

1. Navigate to <your-github-username.github.io/your-repository-name> and you
   will find that your new webpage has gone live! For example, if your GitHub
   username is "lernantino" and the project is "css-demo-site", then your URL
   would be <lernantino.github.io/css-demo-site>.

> **Important**: It might take a few minutes for GitHub pages to display your
> site correctly. If your project does not deploy or display correctly, check
> that all file paths in your application are relative and use the right casing.
> GitHub is case-sensitive, an inccorect capital or lowercase letter could cause
> problems in deployment.

Be sure to add, commit, and push your work to see the most up-to-date version of
your app!
